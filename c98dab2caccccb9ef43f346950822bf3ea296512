      "message": "Thanks for adding the terser plugin already now, but that would mean, that minification step taking place twice:\n\n* 1. by terser plugin\n* 2. by rules_closure in regular polygerrit_plugin:\n\n    polygerrit_plugin(\n        name \u003d \"image-diff\",\n        app \u003d \"plugin-bundle.js\",\n    )\n\nI mean, that should probably work, but may be we shouldn\u0027t do it.\n\nTo make removal of rules_closure less disruptive, we coud probably new introduce skip_minification \u003d True attribute to polygerrit_plugin rule, and once all PG plugins are minifying the JS by themself, using rollup_bundle\u0027s terser plugin, we would be safe to remove rules_closure withmy series.
