      "message": "Nice!\n\nThe thing I don\u0027t understand is why the yarn.lock did not get updated previously even though Gerrit WORKSPACE refers to it (then the build instruction do not ask to symlink it so I don\u0027t know what is installed).\n\nThe package-lock.json is not used by Gerrit / Bazel as far as I understand. I think it was only there as a convenience for local development which surely should instead use yarn.lock.",
